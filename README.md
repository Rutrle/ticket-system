<h1>Welcome to the Smart Ticket</h1>

<hr>

<p>This project is a ticketing system, with flask backend. For frontend are used mainly Bootstrap templates.</p>
<p>Main purpose of this project is for me to get better with flask - because of this many of things that could be probably done better on frontend are done in backend</p>


<h3>TO DO:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>add different times to generated users and tickets in db_setup.py</li>
    <li>use blueprints</li>
    <li>add admin</li>
    <li>add more things to user</li>
    <li>add rich text editor</li>
</ul>
