<h1>Welcome to the Smart Ticket</h1>

<hr>

<p>This project is a ticketing system, with flask backend. For frontend are used mainly Bootstrap5 templates.</p>
<p>Main purpose of this project is for me to get better with flask - because of this many of things that could be probably done better on frontend are done in backend</p>

<h3>Used libraries:<h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Flask-SQLAlchemy</b> for database setup and communication</li>
