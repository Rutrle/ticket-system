            <h1>Welcome to the Smart Ticket</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>This project is a ticketing website system, with flask backend. For frontend were used mainly Bootstrap5
                templates.</p>
            <p>Main purpose of this project is for me to get better with flask framework - because of this many of
                things
                that could be probably done better on frontend are done in backend</p>

            <h1>How does the website work?</h1>
            <hr>
            <h3>Not logged in/unregistered</h3>
            <p>There is not much of the website functionality you can access without logging in/registering</p>
            <p>
                In the navbar, you can click onto following links:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>"SmartTicket"</b> which will take you to the home page
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>"About"</b> ,which will take you to page with information about this website (you are on this
                    page
                    right
                    now)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>"New Ticket"</b> ,which will allow you to create new support ticket in rich text editor, however
                    as
                    you
                    are not logged in, author of it will be anonymous
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>"Login"</b> ,which will take you to the page where you can log in with existing account. If you
                    have forgoten your password, you can reset your password and let it be sent to your e-mail.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>"Register"</b> ,which will allow you to create new account. Althought it's not required to enter
                    your
                    real e-mail, SmartTicket has e-mail sending functionalities, so it's higly recommended to use a real
                    one
                    which you can access. Registering will create a standard user account for you.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <hr>

            <h3>Logged in as standard user</h3>
            <p>When you register and login as standard user you will be able to access most of the SmartTicket
                functionality</p>
            <p>You will be able to create, update and solve tickets</p>
            <p>You will be able to add tickets that interest you into your <b>watchlist</b> and <b>start solving</b> them by adding yourself as one of the current solvers</p>
            <p>You will recieve e-mails about tickets that you are solving or are on your watchlist when they are updated, solved, or reopened</p>
            <p>You will be able to update your account information, like e-mail, profile picture, password...</p>
            <p>There will be now more possibilitis in your navbar, although <b>"SmartTicket" and "About"</b> will remain the same:</p>
